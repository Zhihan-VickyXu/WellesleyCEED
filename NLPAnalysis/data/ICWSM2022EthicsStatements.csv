Community Under Surveillance: Impacts of Marginalization on an Online Labor Forum,"Hanna Barakat, Elissa M. Redmiles",Ethics Statement,"Our  work  was  approved  by  our  institution’s  ethics review board. Despite this approval, tension exists within the literature regarding  the  ethics  of  analyzing  ‘public’  forum data and why,  when,  and  how  users  may  perceive  public  forum  discussions  as  private  (e.g.,  Proferes  et  al.  2021;  Vi-tak, Shilton, and Ashktorab 2016; Eysenbach and Till 2001; Razi, Badillo-Urquiola, and Wisniewski 2020). In this work, we follow guidance from  Cook, Ayers, and Horsch (2018)and  Dym  and  Fiesler  (2020)  on  preserving  the  platform’s anonymity and draw on the established framework from Eysenbach and Till (2001) to assess the ethics of our work. Eysenbach and Till (2001) suggest three central aspects to evaluating the ‘private’ or ‘public’ nature of online sources. First is an assent of access to the forum: is registration necessary to  view  content  or  post?  This  specific  forum  is  an ‘open’ forum and the social media platform does not require registration.  Second,  forum  size;  this  forum  had approximately 85,000 members at the time of data collection, which is between a medium- and large-sized forum for this platform. Third, Eysenbach and Till recommend assessing how members perceive the forum. It is difficult to gauge whether members perceive the forum as public or private. However, posts and comments often allude to the public nature of the content posted.  For  example,  members  warned  each other not to post specific platform names in case law enforcement was monitoring the page and frequently suggested moving conversations out of public view to direct messages. While our assessment along these three criteria suggests that forum members are aware of the public nature of the platform,  to  protect  participants  we  omit  usernames user names (Cook,  Ayers,  and  Horsch  2018;  Dym  and  Fiesler2020),  anonymize  the  platform  and  forum  name,  alter or paraphrase all  quotes  so  they  cannot  be  reverse-searched, and the names of social media sites, messaging applications,and other tools are intentionally removed from this paper to avoid any harmful repercussions to sex workers using those tools (Costanza-Chock 2020)."

To Recommend or Not? A Model-Based Comparison of Item-Matching Processes,"Serina Chang, Johan Ugander",Broader Impact,"Our  work  is  primarily  motivated  by  broader  impacts: our goal is to develop a principled framework through which we can meaningfully assess the impacts of recommender systems on society. Recommender systems are ubiquitous on the web and social media platforms, and have the potential for large-scale negative consequences such as pulling individuals into filter bubbles, increasing population-level polarization, or exacerbating social inequalities. However, in order to distill the role of recommender systems in contributing to these social phenomena, we need to compare user outcomes under recommender systems to a credible assessment of user outcomes without recommender systems. Thus, we develop two contrasting models that capture each of these worlds and systematically compare them, so that we can analyze the consequences of recommender systems relative to a counterfactual world without then. As a model-based approach, we establish key general insights about  recommender  systems,  but  we  do  not make any claims about specific platforms nor do we offer instruction on how real-world recommender systems should be designed.  We  use  real  movie  ratings  data  from  MovieLens to demonstrate that our theoretical results translate to real-world settings, not to demonstrate superior performance on the movie recommendation task. The test users in our simulation experiments are synthetic, generated from a distribution learned  from  the  real  users;  the  real  users  are also anonymized in the data. Practitioners should be aware of the limitations and theoretical nature of our work. They should not directly apply our findings to their domains, but we hope that they appreciate our main takeaways: that recommender systems fundamentally alter how humans interact with content, and that seemingly minor algorithmic decisions (such as regularization) can have major effects on user outcomes."

Echoes through Time: Evolution of the Italian COVID-19 Vaccination Debate,"Giuseppe Crupi, Yelena Mejova, Michele Tizzani, Daniela Paolotti, Andre Panisson",Broader Impact & Ethical Considerations,"Major  efforts  are  ongoing  to  better  understand  the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in Europe and around the world. The  European  Centre  for  Disease  Prevention  and  Control (ECDC) conducts regular surveys to measure COVID-19 behaviors, and supports the inclusion of additional data sources to understand the beliefs and expectations around vaccination (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 2021). The surveillance tools and opinion community detection methods presented in this paper may assist in better understanding the popular sentiments, associations, questions, and misunderstandings that circulate on one of the most popular social media in Italy. Although this dataset captures a small portion of Italian speakers, most social media users do not engage in posting, and use platforms for entertainment and as a source of information (Van Mierlo 2014), thus the potential audience of the content captured here may be a norder of magnitude larger than the users we analyze. Still, we should remember that there are other groups which are not captured in this data, including people not having access to internet and the platform, and those with disabilities not allowing them to interact with it. While the dataset collected  for this  study contains only publicly posted tweets, it is possible that it contains postsfrom  vulnerable  groups,  including  those  with  serious or chronic health conditions relevant to COVID-19 and the vaccination campaigns,  those  emotionally  or psychologically vulnerable, and family members and friends who are concerned for the wellbeing of their loved ones, among others. In order to preserve the privacy of the individual users, we reveal the Twitter handles only of public figures or anonymous accounts in this paper, and otherwise do not use iden-tifiable information in the analysis of the data. Furthermore, we  will  abide  by  Twitter’s  Terms  of  Service (8) by making the IDs  of  the  collected  available  upon  request,  such that those which have been deleted by their authors will not be available when the metadata is re-collected (unfortunately, limiting reproducibility somewhat). However, to support the transparency of  this  work,  we  make  the  code  available to the research community, especially that pertaining community detection, random walk controversy score computation, and community-aware topic modeling9. Finally, as opinion surveillance methods used in this work may be applied to identify other communities and individuals therein, we urge the research  community  to  strictly  abide  by  the  code of ethics for the research and application of these tools (such as one by AAAI10) in order to minimize harm to the subjects of research."
Social Media Reveals Urban-Rural Differences in Stress across China,"Jesse Cui, Tingdan Zhang, Kokil Jaidka, Dandan Pang, Garrick Sherman, Vinit Jakhetiya, Lyle H. Ungar, Sharath Chandra Guntuku","Limitations, Ethics, and Future Work","This study, like several social media based studies, has many limitations. First, our findings may not cover the full picture of stress because of the internet censorship in China (Vuoriand Paltemaa 2015) as we only use publicly available posts. We  assume  a  few  stress-related  words  as  reported  in previous research such as psychosomatic symptoms, substance use, or suicidal ideation may not be present in our dataset because they could harm the establishment of a ‘healthy and harmonious Internet environment’ (Paltemaa et al. 2020). China’s Bureau of Statistics recommends mapping neighborhood committees to urban-rural regions and we did not have access to such granular location for Weibo users in our dataset. That said, the current county tier classification system that maps counties into urban and rural regions based on a tier system serves as a reasonable proxy as has been seen in prior works (Long 2016). Further, we replicated the findings on language data at the province level. Discussions around the use of social media based health indices should include public health experts, computer scientists, lawyers, ethicists,  clinicians,  policy  makers,  and  individuals from different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds (Benton, Coppersmith, and Dredze 2017). There are several potential ways to broaden our findings. First, we analyzed posts that mention several variants of psychological stress which is potentially a subset of all posts that truly indicate a stressed mental state. While language-based estimates of stress have been validated in English using traditional  survey  instruments  (Guntuku  et  al.  2019 a), future work could examine its correlation with other well-being facets in Mandarin. Second, specific sub-populations(e.g. immigrants) who have unique stressors due to diverse reasons (e.g. ‘hukou’) that separate rural and urban residents into disparate social, economic, and political spheres (Chan2014) could be examined. Despite living in cities, migrant peasant workers still maintain their rural hukou type and are treated as rural residents, with little to no access to urban social security, which can trigger different degrees and aspects of stress. Further, users are likely to express themselves differently across social media platforms. In this study, we only used data from one major social media platform - Weibo. It would be interesting to examine if the results would differ in other platforms, as has been found in the US (Jaidka, Guntuku, and Ungar 2018).In summary, our findings suggest that a nuanced analysis of regional social media usage is necessary, in order to situate it in an understanding of the digital divide in internet and social media usage. Differences in social contexts are related to a differential use of social media to cope with daily stressors and act as a buffer for stress and subjective well-being. Despite societal growth and technological advancements, the characteristics of urban and rural life appear to be replicated and reinforced in the online sphere – in context after context, and culture after culture."

Improving Wikidata with Student-Generated Concept Maps,"Hayden Freedman, Andre van der Hoek, Bill Tomlinson",Ethics Statement,"The authors have no conflicts of interests to declare, and believe that the work described in this paper meets the standards of the AAAI Code of Professional Ethics and Conduct. We believe that the enrichment of Wikidata with sustainability knowledge is both socially responsible and broadly accessible. We recognize that crowdsourcing efforts may lead to the introduction of bias in datasets (Ghai et al. 2020); in future work, it will be relevant to determine in what ways bias introduced by students is greater than, less than, or different from  bias  introduced  by  other  crowds.  And,  whileAI systems involve many ethical challenges (Coeckelbergh 2020), this work seeks to produce a more robust knowledge corpus that may enable AI systems to contribute more effectively to the transition to sustainability. By doing so, it may contribute to the well-being of marginalized groups that are most likely to be affected by planetary issues such as climate change."

On the Infrastructure Providers That Support Misinformation Websites,"Catherine Han, Deepak Kumar, Zakir Durumeric",Ethics of Deplatforming,"Our paper focuses on understanding the providers that directly or  indirectly  support  misinformation  websites  and whether  deplatforming  helps  curb  the  spread  of misinformation.  It  remains  an  open  question  whether  companies should deplatform all kinds of misinformation sites, and if they do, how they should choose which sites to deplatform. While a few providers have policies that prohibit misinformation, many do not, which may inadvertently enable misinformation websites to thrive on their platforms. We encourage providers to actively consider writing concrete policies around abusive  content  and  misinformation.  We  also note that several  of  the  largest  ad  providers  have  publicly announced their intent to fight online abusive content and misinformation; however, according to our data, they have failed to take meaningful action against known problematic sites. For instance, over 20% of all misinformation sites rely on Google for ads. These mainstream ad providers are not only supporting misinformation sites by providing them ad revenue, but also profiting from maintaining relationships with these publishers. We encourage providers to reconsider how they are enforcing their policies."

Way, Ian Anderson, Scott Wolf, Alice Wang","Broader  perspective,  ethics  and  competing  interests","We discuss two areas of broader impact of our work: impacts on human subjects, and impacts on future research. We believe our research poses minimal risk to the people included in our analysis. Respondents to our listener survey participated voluntarily and understood they were being surveyed by Spotify for research purposes. Our observational analysis presents  no  further  risk  to  participants  than what they would encounter from use of digital services in their daily life. All findings are aggregate statistics based on large samples. We will not release the raw data on which this analysis is based. While this makes our research less transparent and precludes replication of our study, releasing the raw data poses risk to subjects of de-anonymization, release of sensitive information, and violation of privacy expectations. Our  work  may  also  impact  future  research  on nostalgia, music listening, emotion, and memory. Researchers are rarely able  to  observe  the  behavior  of  large  groups  at the level of individual people over such a long period of time. This  analysis  provides  context  for  estimates  of behavior based on other methods. However, we make several assumptions to conduct this study. Most notably, that our sample is generalizable and  that  our  classifier  is  relatively  accurate. We discuss why we believe these assumptions are reasonable throughout the paper. However, if our assumptions are incorrect, our findings would be misleading. We discuss the limitations of our work throughout the paper and note areas that would especially benefit from additional research"

To this end, model cards (Mitchell et al. 2019) have become an urgent necessity with the release of these FRSs so that they could be used in appropriate contexts only. We believe that this is one of the best way forward in establishing trust with users and stress that it should be made mandatory for all future systems that have real life implications. The foremost goal of every FRS should be to have a fair behavior and all ef-forts must be made in this direction while adhering to privacy and security needs of end users. It is also imperative that organizations release white-papers or hold workshops explaining their technology so that the source of biases can be identified, and hopefully, mitigated."

From an Authentication Question to a Public Social Event: Characterizing Birthday Sharing on Twitter,"Dilara Kekulluoglu, Walid Magdy, Kami Vaniea",Ethical Considerations,"This work aims to measure the prevalence and practice of birthday celebrations  on  Twitter,  a  question  that  is most practically answered by sampling public tweets from Twitter itself. However, such sampling comes with some ethical conundrums since we are using data for research purposes that was initially shared presumably to connect with others. We  are  also  aware  that  some  users  publicly  mention protected accounts, potentially sharing information, like DOB, that the protected user would prefer to keep private. To limit potential negative impacts of our work we take several steps. We only collect publicly available tweets. In the paper  we  report  on  aggregate  information  and refrain from singling out individuals in quotes, links, or anything else identifying.  When  using  quotes,  we  carefully  select those that are generic and represent common tweet content(i.e. “Happy sweet 16th birthday!”). We also do not collector survey participants’ Twitter data or link it to their answers.

Subreddit Links Drive Community Creation and User Engagement on Reddit,"Rachel Krohn, Tim Weninger",Broader Impacts and Ethical Considerations,"The results presented in this paper show that subreddit links have a substantive impact on community creation and activity levels within established communities on Reddit. Based on these findings, we recognize the possible applications, both good and bad. We therefore outline here the potential impacts and strategies to mitigate them. Potential Impacts: As with most social media research, the work presented here is subject to unique ethical considerations. The line between positive and negative outcomes is often very thin in this domain, and the potential uses of subreddit links are no different. Intention and nuance are critical in evaluating the ethics of these community promotions, as the mechanism of use is the same for helpful and harmful instances. Given that we have shown how subreddit links influence the community landscape on Reddit, one possible negative outcome is the manipulation of these subreddit links by bad actors to push a particular agenda or viewpoint. Community-focused misinformation contributes to siloing and echo chambers, fueling conflict. Similarly, users could co-opt common links by creating a community whose purpose does not match the subreddit name, potentially exposing other users to harmful or malicious content. To mitigate these negative impacts, Reddit and other social media platforms may need to monitor the frequency of subreddit links and the formation of new communities to detect and intervene in cases of misuse. There are also positive outcomes that could result from this work. First, a better understanding of the power of subreddit links could allow for new avenues of content promotion. For example, users can direct other commenters to specific helpful subreddits based on the context of the discussion. This is already a common use case of subreddit links, but with concrete evidence of link impact, organizations could adopt the convention for good, like recommendation of mental health communities. Subreddit links could also be leveraged in the fight against misinformation and disinformation, by directing users to communities with more rigorous moderation and fact-checking. LimitationsThese findings are limited to subreddit communities on Reddit. These findings are likely to generalize to other social media platforms, but further experiments are required to confirm. Our experiments assume that all subreddit links are deliberate choices made by users, and therefore may incorrectly capture some links that were mistakes or typos. However, even if a subreddit link was made by mistake, any well-formed link will point to a subreddit that may or may not exist. In compiling the link dataset, we considered all well-formed links, without filtering for link score or visibility, community size, or other factors that could impact a link’s effectiveness. Future work investigating these nuances may reveal trends or effect not discovered in this aggregate analysis. Data Collection and Privacy ConsiderationsBecause this data contains artifacts of human subjects, we sought human subjects review from the ethical review board at the University of Notre Dame; an exemption was granted for this study on the basis that all data was public and no treatments were conducted by the research team. Additionally, most Reddit users act anonymously, but any personal information was  willingly  shared  by  the  user.  All results presented are in aggregate. We did not seek nor attempt to de-anonymize any data and therefore do not reveal any private or personally identifying information. The  dataset  used  for  experiments  is  available  fromfiles.pushshift.io/reddit. We encourage interested parties to contact us for more details on dataset compilation and analysis.  All plots include confidence intervals as appropriate. All experiments were conducted on a local high-capacity CPU machine."
Conversational Resilience: Quantifying and Predicting Conversational Outcomes Following Adverse Events,"Charlotte Lambert, Ananya Rajagopal, Eshwar Chandrasekharan","Broader Perspective, Ethics, and Competing Interests.","This  research  has  implications  for  improving community health beyond  Reddit—our  methods  can  be  extended  to other  online  spaces  that  allow  for  threaded  conversations. But  using  our  findings  at  face-value  to  guide moderation strategies may have negative effects on users. For example, we observe that users with a history of removed comments may incite  future  removals.  Should  moderators  decide to keep an eye on users with a history of norm violations or newcomers still learning community norms, it may become difficult for them to learn how to participate meaningfully. With  respect  to  data  collection  and  analysis,  we recognize that using “removed data” (i.e., moderated comments released by prior work) can give rise to ethical concerns. Before performing this research, we discussed these issues with our IRB and colleagues. Based on our discussions, we concluded that examining moderated comments provided valuable insights  about  online  governance,  and  as  long  as we mitigated potential risks, the benefits outweighed the risks. In an effort to mitigate risks, we purposefully discard comments deleted by the author, which we believe would violate the author’s privacy. Finally, we used public data collected via Pushshift API to protect Reddit itself from harm."

An important aspect that we need to consider while working with health-related issues is to respect the users’ privacy and adhere to good ethical practices adapted by previous research (Henderson, Johnson, and Auld 2013; Alim 2014). Therefore, similar to Matthews2017-cn, we censor several sensitive information, such as user names, personal information, platform identifiers, and urls which might be directly linked to the users’ identity, from the collected posts and comments. All examples used in this paper are anonymized, and de-identified for user privacy(Hunter et al. 2018). We also adopted the proposed guidelines for treatment of Names and Online Pseudonyms in posts and comments gathered from Reddit (Bruckman 2002).In this work, We study expressed symptoms in mental health subreddit groups in the form of textual interactions. The expressed symptom may differ from the symptom actually perceived or experienced by the person. However, obtaining perceived symptoms from social media is challenging and involves ethical risks. We can adopt the approach used in this work to develop the data set with more human supervision and we acknowledge that the data may be prone to demo-graphic, annotator, and platform-specific biases (Preo ̧tiuc-Pietro et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2019). We also acknowledge that the current work does not make any clinical diagnosis or treatment suggestions in any manner whatsoever."

Glowing Experience or Bad Trip? A Quantitative Analysis of User Reported Drug Experiences on Erowid.org,"Angelina Mooseder, Momin M. Malik, Hemank Lamba, Earth Erowid, Sylvia Thyssen, Jurgen Pfeffer",Ethical Considerations,"We are conducting research on open (though anonymous or pseudonymous)  admissions  of  sometimes  illegal  behavior, and we have a responsibility to not put together data in such a way that it would deanonymize individuals and potentially put them at risk. When submitting reports, users explicitly grant permission to use their reports for scientific research. Therefore, care is already taken in the writing and editing process to omit or obscure identifiable details. Our data contains no personal identifiable information (PII). Nothing in our models tries to fill in or infer information from individual reports that could help identify the authors. Second, the manufacture, distribution, possession and/or consumption of many of the substances described in ErowidExperience  Reports  are  illegal  in  many  or  most jurisdictions. By studying these reports in a nonjudgmental way, we risk abetting and condoning behavior that could be illegal and that many consider immoral. However, there is a long precedent in sociology and anthropology of studying such behavior; for drugs specifically, we work within the educational and harm reduction frameworks (Marlatt 1996) supported by Erowid and by many biomedical researchers, social workers, and medical practitioners. Harm reduction is an evidence-based approach built on more than three decades of empirical research (Stone and Shirley-Beavan 2018), and it prioritizes providing accurate, judgment-free information, safe  environments  for  drug  consumption,  addiction treatment, and decriminalization of drug usage and markets, all of which lead to less harm from drug consumption. The current study obtained the explicit consent of Erowid Center before downloading reports off their website. Furthermore, we recognize the labor and expertise of the Erowid staff members through co-authorship"

Specifically,  by  presenting  results  aggregated  over  thousands of users and  by  intentionally  not  reporting  any  exact quotes made by Reddit users, we reduce the risk of re-identification. Finally, throughout this study, we analyze non-confidential Reddit data  that  is  available  in  the  public  domain, collected through the publicly accessible Reddit Pushshift API (Baumgartner et al. 2020).  Yet,  given  the  potential stigma associated with participating in CT discussions, we do not release any raw user data from this study."

It is also possible, as illustrated here, to make use of personal data while also maintaining participant  privacy.  For  this  work,  we  allowed the user to  upload their  own  data  files and  did  not  store their personal data, only their responses to our prompts. Personal data should never be used in a group setting. Any instructions should be mindful of potentially sensitive content that the user may not expect or intend to inspect. This could be explicitly sensitive content such as aspects of identity, or evenless  obvious  content  such  as  recent  experiences  or events that are recorded in the personal data (e.g. reminds the person of a breakup or death). We recommend that participants filter their own data for what they would like to use for the remainder of the tutorial (as we did in this study); while it is difficult to avoid unanticipated sensitive data altogether, this process can lessen exposure and harm.

We asked for informed consent from participants. We made sure to take suitable steps in our data collection and analysis to ensure an ethical study and preserve user privacy. Additionally, in order to avoid any issues of account or user identification and to protect user privacy, we did not name any accounts in  this  paper.  In  particular,  we  note  that  we did not debrief  the  participants.  Several  recent  studies  did the briefing to minimize the impacts of misinformation over time (Murphy et al. 2020). Thus, we acknowledge that the lack of debriefing in our experiments could have potentially harmful effects on some participants (e.g., those in the control condition without misinformation correction). However, as a recent study revealed, misinformation study in general does not significantly increase participant’s long-term susceptibility to misinformation used in the experiments (Murphy et al. 2020)."

"From Hesitancy Framings to Vaccine Hesitancy Profiles: A Journey of Stance, Ontological Commitments and Moral Foundations","Maxwell A. Weinzierl, Sanda M. Harabagiu",Ethics Statement,"Accurate vaccine hesitancy profiling at scale has the potential to enable public health researchers to design customized interventions to target users most likely to be convinced to vaccinate. Public health outreach could become much more personalized, directly addressing the themes, concerns, and moral priorities held by users on Twitter. Potential downsides to the approach outlined in this paper include the mistaken assignment of Twitter users to hesitancy profiles, due to sarcasm, jokes, or untruthful postings, which may be difficult for our system to recognize. Additionally, many users may change their stance and remove or rebut their own tweets over time. The downside of mistaken user hesitancy profiling is minimal, as we expect our system to be used by public health practitioners when developing their interventions. Questionnaires that precede the application of an intervention would filter out Twitter for incorrect hesitancy profiles. Our data collection process was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas at Dallas. All tweets collected were public, and only the tweet IDs and annotations will be shared, such that others must go through the approval process to use the data. We expect COVAXFRAMES would become a valuable resource for identifying Vaccine Hesitancy Framings, and recognizing the stance each Twitter user has towards those framings. While we believe that the annotation quality of COVAXFRAMESishigh (0.67 Cohen’s Kappa score), mistakes in judgments of stance are likely due to difficult complex phenomena, such as sarcasm. We believe that such potential misjudgments are rare and thus minimally impact the quality of the hesitancy profiles."

Zhang, Tim Althoff",Ethical Considerations,"We  strongly  believe  that  this  work  will  have  a positive broader impact by informing the design of online communities in a manner which is aligned with the values of their members. The most serious potential negative impact of this work is the potential for deanonymization of responses. Take this possibility seriously and have taken numerous steps to mitigate this risk. To ensure the anonymity of our participants, we do not publish their usernames nor any of their red-dit usage data, and remove responses from subreddits whose names or  small  size  could  enable  deanonymization  of individual contributors to our public dataset. All participants were informed of the goals of the study and how we would use and share their data before consenting to participate. In a separate step of the survey, we collect specific additional consent to access users’ public reddit histories and use them for research (Fiesler and Proferes 2018), which we do not publish.

Limits of Multilayer Diffusion Network Inference in Social Media Research,"Yan Xia, Ted Hsuan Yun Chen, Mikko Kivelä",Ethical Statement,"From a broader perspective, our work further connects the technical literature of multilayer diffusion network inference to their  empirical  applications  on  real  social  media  data. Such  empirical  studies  may  help  uncover  nuanced homogeneity and heterogeneity in the spreading of online content, and thus advance our understanding of information propagation and opinion dynamics in online social networks. In particular,  they  could  reveal  a  richer  spreading  context  ofmisleading or harmful content, and inspire designs of more effective regulation measures. On  the  other  hand,  by  showcasing  the  potential  use  ofthe inference framework on social media data and providing an open-source implementation of it, our work potentially induces a risk for people to apply the framework on unanonymized social media data, consequently inferring the connection between real users and how ideas spread among them.  We  therefore  encourage  the  users  of  the  inference framework to always apply it to spreading data with identifying information removed, and interpret the revealed spread-ing dynamics from a content-oriented perspective"

Analysis of publicly available data that could suggest current or prospective mental health disorders poses privacy concerns as well as broader ethical questions about undertaking research in this area. To decrease traceability, we took great care in how the data and analyses were presented in the study for each disorder, for example, by omitting any personally identifying information such as tagged users or web-links in the data we provide. Several discussions around ethical considerations for usingTwitter dataset concluded that it can ethically be used for research as it is one of the expected use cases of data that Twitter users agree to in terms and conditions (5)."
Turning Stocks into Memes: A Dataset for Understanding How Social Communities Can Drive Wall Street,"Richard Alvarez, Paras Bhatt, Xingmeng Zhao, Anthony Rios",Ethical Statement,"The authors of this paper acknowledge reading and abiding by the AAAI code of conduct and ethical guidelines for this submission. We acknowledge the risk that as our paper ob-serves the human behavior of persuasion and social manipulation, those with unsavory intent can abuse the research for their ends. Nevertheless, we posit that research on how to manipulate and socially engineer is already available. Social manipulation is already a problem. Fake news, for example, is the major challenge for our time, and by not studying how manipulation occurs, we cannot learn how vulnerable we are and how to defend against it effectively. This dataset aims to provide a freely available corpus for peer-to-peer conversations that can confirm user support for a campaign (e.g., supporting GameStop) and user intentions to make a purchase(e.g., GME shares). Our research does not use any individuals personal information, nor any identifiable info to put the individual at risk. All information was taken from publicly available data on Reddit."

Additional details of its composition has been described in an earlier section and in Tables 2.3 and 1. By its nature, the dataset is a non-random sample from the set of all Twitter Users. Only 2 fields (’url’ and ’location’) may have missing information for some instances - these are self-reported  values  and  their  availability  depends  entirely on whether the Twitter user has shared any such value. All other fields have no missing values. By it’s nature, the dataset can be used  to  identify  individuals,  more  specifically, Twitter users. Apart from certain self-reported fields, such as location - no other field contains any sensitive information. All fields in the dataset are derived from the Twitter API and is public to general audiences. Since the dataset involves manual annotation of the “category” and “subcategory” fields, a small margin of human error is to be expected. In the absence of any real measure of ground-truth, we are unable to evaluate this error percentage quantitatively. Uses: This  dataset,  subsets  and  expansions thereof,  have been used,  and  are  currently  being  used  in  several academic projects. We list some published research using this dataset in a  prior  section.  We  also  outline  other  possible  uses in the aforementioned section on applications. We note that all uses of the dataset must be cognizant of unavoidable errors that may have crept in as a result of manual annotation. Certain fields (“username”, “description”, “followers” etc.) may change over time – we recommend updating these fields us-ing the Twitter API and the “idstr” field before the dataset is used in any application involving these fields. We reiterate that the primary contribution of this dataset is the annotation of “categories” and “subcategories”.Distribution and MaintenanceWe have hosted the dataset on Dataverse. It may be accessed directly from Dataverse for any uses. Our main fields of interest are ’category’ and ’subcategory’ - these will not be updated unless to correct labelling errors. In case of the latter, kindly contact the authors. By it’s nature, this dataset may be augmented and expanded upon by users to tailor it to their specific needs. The authors cannot guarantee or verify such modifications, however. FAIRness of the Dataset: We  host  our  dataset  (along  with  metadata)  on  Dataverse. Dataverse is an open-source data repository software used widely, which provides a convenient way for dataset authors to adhere to FAIR (Wilkinson et al. 2016) principles. Our attempt at the same involves: Findability: Dataverse assigns a unique DOI (DocumentObject Identifier) when a dataset is published. This DOI resolves to a landing page with metadata, data files, terms, waivers and licenses. Accessibility:    Dataverse    provides    public    machine-accessible   interfaces   to   search   the   data,   access   the metadata  and  download  the  data  files,  using  a  token to grant access when data files are restricted (‘A’). Interoperability and Resuablility: Dataverse offers the metadata at following 3 levels of hierarchy: 1. data citation metadata (DataCite or Dublin Core) 2.  domain-specific metadata 3.  file-level metadata"

Twitter Corpus of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement and Counter Protests: 2013 to 2021,"Salvatore Giorgi, Sharath Chandra Guntuku, Mckenzie Himelein-Wachowiak, Amy Kwarteng, Sy Hwang, Muhammad Rahman, Brenda Curtis",Ethics Statement,"Here   we   consider   the   ethical   questions   outlined   in Datasheets  for  Datasets  (Gebru  et  al.  2021).  As  with  any Twitter data set, there are a number of ethical concerns, especially due  to  the  nature  of  this  data  set  (i.e.,  racial justice and grassroots social movements). First, it is possible to identify individuals within the data set, though we note that this is only possible after rehydrating the tweet set and only because the data is publicly available (i.e., public Twitter profiles with public tweets). Thus, an individual would have to have posted something identifying on their account at some point in time that remains public at the time of rehydration. Along with any Twitter data, there are other possibly sensitive attributes such as images, location information, and friend/follower networks. Due to the nature of the dataset,  this  could  also  potentially  identify  a  person’s support or opposition to a political movement. Finally, no individuals within the data set have consented to the authors to have their data shared, though, again, we note that the data used in this article is publicly available and distributed within Twit-ter’s Terms of Services (i.e., only numeric tweet IDs are distributed). While there is no official way to “revoke consent”, Twitter users may delete tweets, delete accounts, or set accounts to private, at which point any tweet in our data set would no longer be available. It was our hope that repulling all data at the time of writing would ensure the numbers reported within reflect the most current publicly available version of the data set. While we have released tweets related to counter protests(All Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter), the authors do not intend to  draw  equivalences  between  the  counter protests and Black  Lives  Matter.  Despite  the  fact  that  all  three protests are given equal space in the analysis, we believe the numbers reported show a different story: an overwhelming majority of  tweets  are  related to Black Lives Matter as opposed to the other protests. It is our hope that this data set is used for social good,though there are a number of questionable use cases such as  monitoring  or  forecasting  of  protests  by  law enforcement. As such, we limit the distribution of this data to non-commercial, research entities in hopes of limiting surveil-lance type tasks by for-profit entities."

A Large-Scale Longitudinal Multimodal Dataset of State-Backed Information Operations on Twitter,"Xiaobo Guo, Soroush Vosoughi",Ethics Statement,"The positive dataset presented in this paper is from Twitter’stransparency report of information operations, and the negative dataset is from the Internet Archive, both of which are publicly available with strict privacy standards. We do not release any data that is not part of these two public repositories. The main ethical consideration related to the use of our dataset is  the  problem  of  false  positives,  which  refers to wrongly labeling an “innocent” user or tweet as being state-sponsored. Considering the potential real-world negative impact of false positive prediction for users (ranging from social stigma to putting their lives in danger) and society as a whole (e.g., harming freedom of speech and the diversity of ideas), it is important to be cautious when creating models for identifying state-sponsored accounts and propaganda. Furthermore, according to our definition of state-sponsored tweets, any tweet that is shared by state-sponsored accounts is labeled as being state-sponsored, even if the original tweet that was shared came from a non-state-sponsored account. Thus, it is extremely important for any paper relying on our dataset to include thorough analysis of false positives and explicitly discuss issues mentioned here."
A Labeled Dataset for Investigating Cyberbullying Content Patterns in Instagram,"Mara Hamlett, Grace Powell, Yasin N. Silva, Deborah Hall",Ethical Considerations,"A number of ethical considerations guided the labeling process and procedures. First, efforts were made to ensure sociodemographic and disciplinary diversity among the team of annotators. As mentioned previously, our team of annotators comprised  individuals  with  variability in level  and area  of  academic  training,  age,  and  multiple  dimensions of identity (e.g.,  race, ethnicity, gender identity,  membership in theLGBTQ+ community). The collection of annotator demographic data was performed in a way that minimized the number of team members able to access this information; the survey was anonymous, with each annotator receiving only a numerical ID, and only one member of the research team (the first author) had full access to the survey. Privacy of the Instagram users whose comments comprised the dataset was also prioritized, as no attempts were made to discover the identities of the users at any point. Our main goal for the dataset and this paper is to facilitate future work that uses psychological frameworks to better understand cyberbullying in social media data and inform the development of more effective cyberbullying detection models. A vital secondary goal, however, is to maintain the privacy  of those included  in  the  dataset. To this end, researchers who request access to the dataset through the researchers’  project  website (https://ysilva.cs.luc.edu/Bully-Blocker/data) will be required to maintain the privacy of the users and annotators who contributed to the labeled dataset and ethicality in the use of the data."
The Reddit Politosphere: A Large-Scale Text and Network Resource of Online Political Discourse,"Valentin Hofmann, Hinrich Schütze, Janet B. Pierrehumbert",Ethical Statement,"This work is entirely based on public data. To protect the identity of individual users, the Reddit Politosphere is fully pseudonymized, which sets it apart from most other datasets based on Reddit, including PRD. We expect the Reddit Politosphere to be particularly valuable for  research  on  social  and  political  questions, which bears the risk that skews and biases in the data impact the results and conclusions based on them. In this respect, we highlight that the user base of Reddit is not representative of the overall US population. Specifically, it is younger, more male, and more liberal (Shatz 2017). This needs to be kept in mind when using the Reddit Politosphere. We further notice that we design the Reddit Politosphereto fully adhere to the FAIR principles: it is findable as it is made publicly  available  on  a  registered  and  indexed platform (Zenodo); it is accessible by its unique and persistent DOI as well as the descriptions provided in the metadata, including this paper; it is interoperable as it leverages open and machine-readable data formats (bz2, csv, and json); it is reusable as it is published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license."

In addition, the media files contain recordings of physical violence against people, scenes of injuries and suffering people, verbal harassment against people, and in some cases also appeals to kill police officers and politicians. Like other datasets from “dark” platforms, these data need to be handled with caution."
NELA-Local: A Dataset of U.S. Local News Articles for the Study of County-Level News Ecosystems,"Benjamin D. Horne, Maurício Gruppi, Kenneth Joseph, Jon Green, John P. Wihbey, Sibel Adalı",FAIR Principles,"The NELA-Local dataset   follows   FAIR   principles (8). Namely,  the  data Findable,  as  it  is  persistently  stored on Harvard Dataverse  and  is  described  with  rich  metadata.The  data  is Accessible and Interoperable,  as  it  is retrievable through Harvard Dataverse’s GUI and is stored in two widely-used, standard formats (SQLite3 and CSV), including sample Python scripts for extraction. Given the formats, the data can be parsed by both machine and human annotators. Additionally, this paper describes metadata and points users to other datasets that can complement and augment this dataset (see Section 6). Lastly, the data isRe-usable, as it is open for free use, ready to use out-of-the-box in a wide range of local news studies, and contains original article URLs and metadata links/documentation to maintain provenance."
Homepage2Vec: Language-Agnostic Website Embedding and Classification,"Sylvain Lugeon, Tiziano Piccardi, Robert West",Ethical Statement,"Curlie  moderators  make  sure  the  dataset  does  not contain websites  promoting  individual  products, marketing schemes, or illegal content. Additionally, since we collected only the websites of unrestricted categories, adult content is also excluded from our dataset. Finally, in this work, we relied on the work of human annotators on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Worker compensation was  in  line  with  ethical  guidelines  (Salehiet al. 2015; Whiting, Hugh, and Bernstein 2019)."
TWikiL – the Twitter Wikipedia Link Dataset,Florian Meier,Ethical and FAIR Considerations,"Personal  data: Neither TWikiL raw nor TWikiL curated contain   personally   identifiable   information. While we further process the links included in Tweets and associate them with Wikidata identifiers, we do not derive or infer potentially sensitive characteristics about Twitter users or perform user-based off-Twitter matching, i.e. we do not associate ”Twitter content, including a Twitter username or user ID, with a person, household, device, browser, or other off-Twitter identifier” (Twitter 2021a). FAIR principles: The  FAIR  guiding  principles  for scientific data  management  and  stewardship  dictate  that digital assests  including  datasets  need  to  be  findable, accessible,  interoperable  and  reusable  (Wilkinson  et  al.  2016). By  making  our  dataset  available  via  Zenodo  (EuropeanOrganization  For  Nuclear  Research  and  OpenAIRE  2013) we  comply  with  most  FAIR  principles  as  they  are practically inherent in the service (Zenodo 2022). For example, via ZenodoTWikiLis assigned a digital object identifier(DOI),  a  globally  unique  and  persistent  identifier,  and is findable and accessible via the services’ search engine. The dataset is  published  in  CSV  (TWikiL raw)  and  SQLite(TWikiL curated)  format  respectively  which  are  both public-domain and recommended storage formats by the Library of  Congress  (SQLite  2018).  The  fact  that  every entry, i.e. link in our dataset, is associated with it’s Wikidataidentifier greatly enhances the dataset’s interoperability and reusability. Researchers can easily joinTWikiLwith other Wikipedia  and  Wikidata  related  datasets  that  contain  the Wikidata  identifier  which  broadens  the  possible  use cases and benefits the scientific community. To further enhance the dataset's reusability, we published example code on how to make use of the dataset on Github11. The files found at this address  exemplify  how  to  work  with  the  SQLite  databasefrom R and can be used to reproduce all descriptive statistics and visualisations presented in this paper. In addition to that, we provide skeleton code that allows to retrieve Tweet objects based on Tweet IDs using the R packager tweet (Kear-ney 2019). Viartweet, collecting Tweet objects can be done with a regular Twitter user account. A developer account is not necessary."
"""I Can’t Keep It Up."" A Dataset from the Defunct Voat.co News Aggregator","Amin Mekacher, Antonis Papasavva",Fair Principles,"The data released and presented in this paper aligns  with  the  FAIR  guiding  principles  for scientific data, as described below:12•Findable:  We  assign  a  unique  constant  digital object identifier (DOI) to our dataset (Zenodo 2021) (13). Accessible: Our dataset is openly accessible. Interoperable: We use JSON format to store our datasets since it is widely used for storing data and can be used in various programming languages. We also provide a detailed description of our dataset’s format in Section 5. Reusable:  We  provide  all  the  available  metadata along with our dataset and we extensively document them in this paper, in Section 5. Ethical Considerations. The data collected, presented, and released with this paper are available on the Wayback Machine and also used to be accessible (without the need of a registered account) on Voat before it went down. The collection and release of this dataset does not violate Voat’s or Wayback Machine’s Terms of Service. Although some sub-verses on Voat allowed users to post anonymously, the overwhelming majority did not offer this functionality. Hence, we collect user profile data of 114K users. The only identification of these user profiles is the unique pseudo name, which is not personally identifiable information. Analysis of the activity generated on Voat to other services could potentially be used to de-anonymize users. We note that we followed standard ethical guidelines (Rivers and Lewis 2014)and made no attempt to de-anonymize users."
FaCov: COVID-19 Viral News and Rumors Fact-Check Articles Dataset,"Shakshi Sharma, Ekanshi Agrawal, Rajesh Sharma, Anwitaman Datta",Dataset FAIRness,"FaCov has been made openly available in the CSV format for download in accordance with FAIR standards (Wilkinson  et  al.  2016).  The  dataset  is Findable as  it  is publicly available on Zenodo, with a digital object identifier (DOI): https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5854656. It is also Accessible since anyone in the world can retrieve it through the DOI link. The dataset is in the CSV format; hence it is Interoperable and can be read by any common CSV reader, spreadsheet program, or programming language. Also, the raw content of the articles is provided directly, allowing the users of our dataset to experiment with and reuse the data for their own studies while making use of the supplementary README file provided to understand the data files in detail. The dataset section has a detailed discussion of how the dataset and other variables were gathered, as well as a list of metadata items gathered in conjunction with the article. For ease of (re)use and access to articles, we have supplied the URLs of the fact-check articles from the scraped websites to make the original articles available, enhancing reusability, reproducibility, and provenance. While the dataset by itself is self-sufficient, the content and its availability at these URLs are handled by the websites. We have made sure that the selected websites are open to the public and do not have any access restrictions. This is meaningful because if a user of the  dataset  wants  to  learn  more  about  an  article, they should be able to do so directly from our source. In case an article is later unavailable at the URL, tools like the Internet Archive (7) can also be used for such openly available content."
FactDrill: A Data Repository of Fact-Checked Social Media Content to Study Fake News Incidents in India,"Shivangi Singhal, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru",FAIR Principles,"Our  proposed  FactDrill  dataset  adheres  to  the  four FAIRdataprinciples: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and  Reusable,  as  follows: (i) The  complete  dataset is publicly available  at  the  following  link:  (Dataset  DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5854856)    (Dataset    URL: https://zenodo.org/record/5854856) makingFactDrill dataset  easily  Findable  and  Accessible, (ii) The  proposeddataset  is  provided  in  an  xlsx  (Excel  Spreadsheet) format that can be viewed and parsed easily. We have also provided a detailed  explanation  of  each  attribute  in  the  FactDrill dataset in Section Dataset Attributes. In addition to that, it can be  exported  to  other  data  formats  like  CSV  (CommaSeparated  Values),  making  FactDrill  dataset  Interoperable and Reusable."
MMCHIVED: Multimodal Chile and Venezuela Protest Event Data,"Zachary Steinert-Threlkeld, Jungseock Joo",Ethical Statement,"Participation in a protest event as well as posting an image about it on social media can lead to harmful outcomes to individuals because state authorities or political opponents may attempt to track them down. To protest the identities of protest participants and Twitter users, we do not share any images or individual tweets. The dataset was completely made from public content in Twitter. All metadata are aggregated at the city-day level. We believe that our dataset will contribute to fairer and less-filtered reports about protest events and facilitate relevant research."
The MeLa BitChute Dataset,"Milo Z. Trujillo, Maurício Gruppi, Cody Buntain, Benjamin D. Horne",FAIR Principles and Ethical Considerations of Stored Data,"We are careful to ensure that theMeLa-BitChutedatasetfollows FAIR principles (2).  Findable - The dataset is persistently stored on Harvard Dataverse, is documented, and described with rich meta-data.  Accessible - The dataset is freely and publicly accessible through  Harvard  Dataverse’s  GUI,  is  stored  in  two widely-used formats, and comes with an example Pythonscript for data extraction and use. Interoperable - The dataset can be parsed automatically using standard languages (Python, SQL, R), and can be parsed by human annotators using the CSV formats provided. Reusable  -  The  data  can  be  reused  for  many  types of studies, given the breadth of the collection. The data can be paired and augmented with other social media datasets for rich studies of alt-tech, deplatforming, disinformation spread and more. See Section 5 for an in-depth discussion of these use cases. Given that the URLs are stored and rich metadata is well-documented, provenance is maintained. The key ethical consideration with the collection and sharing of this dataset is the privacy of the platform’s producers and consumers. While we considered anonymizing the content producers (channels/profiles), we choose not to as their identity is important to understand both activity within the platform and studies across other platforms. Censoring the channel and video URLs would reduce the dataset’s usefulness in  the  research  community  and  would  destroy the provenance of the data. Furthermore, since the content producers on BitChute post videos for public consumption, they should not have the expectation of anonymity. On the other hand, we do choose to anonymize the comment posters. We have assigned each commenter a unique ID, by creating a salted hash of their account information. This allows researchers to identify all comments made by a  particular  author,  without  revealing  the  username  of the author. We do this because commenters have a greater expectation of privacy than content publishers, and the right to be forgotten. Furthermore, the importance of tracking influential content creators across multiple platforms does not apply to commenters."
PrivacyAlert: A Dataset for Image Privacy Prediction,"Chenye Zhao, Jasmine Mangat, Sujay Koujalgi, Anna Squicciarini, Cornelia Caragea",Ethical Statement,"We use the “Public Domain Dedication” and the “Public Domain Mark” licenses in Flickr API for image crawling. Accordingly,  our  dataset  only  includes  images  with  a public license. Also, our dataset only includes images and tags, every image is privy to potentially personally identifying meta-data. Images are collected using generic keywords instead of user information as queries, therefore our dataset does not have a large collection of images from an individual user."

Classifying Minority Stress Disclosure on Social Media with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory,"Cory J. Cascalheira, Shah Muhammad Hamdi, Jillian R. Scheer, Koustuv Saha, Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi, Munmun De Choudhury",Broader Perspectives and Ethics,"Despite these limitations, detecting minority stress on social media with sequence models warrants further research. If sequence models can accurately classify minority stress disclosure, then their deployment as services could (a) identify SGM Internet users most at risk for adverse consequences; (b) link SGM people to professional care (e.g., personalized ads to SGM-affirming therapists); and (c) generate brief, automated interventions (e.g., chatbots to affirm disclosure, screen for comorbid risks, and link to resources). Without addressing the above limitations, definitive conclusions about the potential of sequence models to classify minority stress on social media remain elusive. Several ethical considerations are worth mentioning. First, SGM people may use social media for relative anonymity. If algorithms identify posts as evincing minority stress, then SGM users maybe targeted by malicious others. Relatedly, if an SGM user discloses minority stress that is based on or political injustice, then it is possible that the user could be identified by the perpetrator. We minimized these risks by using Reddit, which is relatively more anonymous than services such as Facebook. Second, although SGM people consent to third parties accessing their information by signing up for Reddit, it is neither clear whether SGM users would consent to the computational classification of their content nor whether they would appreciate the algorithmic interventions proposed above. As Saha et al. (2019) concluded, it is imperative that minority stress classification from social media data does no harm and benefits the SGM community."

Measuring Media Bias via Masked Language Modeling,"Xiaobo Guo, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi",Ethics Statement,"This paper proposes a novel method for studying the relative bias of news outlets with respect to different issues using masked  language  modeling.  Though  the  issue  of bias in news  is  controversial,  this  paper  only  studies  therela-tivebias between outlets. We do not make any judgements as to  whether  certain  outlets  are  biased,  our  method only reports the relative difference between the outlets. All text used in this paper come from public news outlets and were collected using the publicly available API of Media Cloud. As such, the data does not contains any private information. Since we use mainstream news outlets for our data collection we believe there is less risk of overtly unethical information (though we cannot be sure given the current sociopolitical climate). Given the relatively large size of our dataset, we cannot manually examine all articles, however, the publicly released  dataset  will  warn  users  of  the  possibility of the dataset containing unethical information and will allows users to flag unethical articles in our dataset. Finally, as we use pre-trained language models in our paper, we must be aware of the inherent bias in such models(based on their pre-training data) and again err on the side of caution when utilizing such models for consequential applications."
