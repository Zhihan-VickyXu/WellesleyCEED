       "      <td>While our research aims to generate positive societal impact via increasing equity in SNAP enrollment, there remains a primary ethical consideration: in optimizing for SNAP enrollment among minority demographics, we inherently reduce the SNAP enrollment among majority demographics. Below, we discuss this trade-off and its potential societal impact, as well as concerns arising from data collection. For each  source  of  potential  negative  societal  impact,  we  describe the principles used to mitigate our concerns. The crux of our work involves setting a fixed budget for an advertising bidding algorithm, and optimizing for potential SNAP enrollees who are Spanish speakers. For each additional Spanish speaking individual presented with a Get-CalFresh  ad,  we  will  necessarily  decrease  the  number  of English speaking individuals presented with the same ad — potentially by more than one. The long term consequences of  our  experiment  include  that  certain  individuals belonging to majority groups will not be shown the GetCalFresh ad, and will thus have a lower likelihood of filling out Get-CalFresh’s SNAP application when searching for the same Google keywords that would otherwise trigger the GetCal-Fresh ad to be shown. Across California, we hope to see an increase in SNAP applications from individuals who would not otherwise have easily found the online resources to complete the forms, in keeping with GetCalFresh’s goal of assisting the neediest individuals. If applied broadly, our framework can be used to substantiate decision-makers’ choices across a range of algorithm-based applications. Depending on the individuals and groups whose preferences are surveyed, this could either yield policy suggestions that propose more equity-based allocations, or ones that propose more efficiency-based allocations as is the norm. The key distinction will stem from whose preferences are elicited, and whether their fairness preferences are biased outside the scope of the efficiency-equity trade-off. One way to ameliorate this concern is to ensure representation of underrepresented groups among individuals whose preferences are being elicited (Kasy and Abebe 2021; Whit-taker 2020). As  to  the  ethical  challenges  of  data  collection,  this research uses data on three fronts: first, from Google ad target-ing towards a large swath of Google users in California; second, from Code for America’s compilation of GetCalFreshapplications; and third, from our Prolific survey. In Google ad targeting, we do not have access to any individual-level data; rather, we can only see audience-level statistics (e.g., how many total impressions or clicks were received on an ad). In the GetCalFresh applications, Code for America continuously tracks all applications that come through its system,  but  takes  particular  care  to  ensure  data  privacy.  For example, even though one could argue the benefits of collecting race-based data from users to optimize for racial equity, the GetCalFresh application does not collect race data at all because the application does not require race information. Further, our team only obtained access to anonymized household-level data pertaining to the research at hand. In the Prolific survey, we pre-registered our experiment viaAsPredicted(#84866),  indicating  what  individual-level  data we aimed to collect; we made the decision to not publicly re-lease said data for Prolific user privacy reasons—our dataset includes sensitive  information  such  as  political  affiliationand income levels, which were imperative to collect to understand the socioeconomic drivers of fairness preferences. Across these three data sources, we have minimized the potential data privacy harm to the extent possible while still allowing for this research to be conducted. The survey question text,  along  with  code  reproducing  data  analysis,  are posted on GitHub for reproducibility. Across both the inherent demographic trade-off and data privacy considerations, we have made the choices we feel best  lead  to  equitable  outcomes  for  the  neediest  potential GetCalFresh users, with minimal harm to the broader set of potential users. While our research focuses on SNAP within California, there is room for future work both across America, and via analogous food stamp programs globally. However, our design choices would need to be revisited since the concept of neediest recipients may vary considerably in different contexts.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As network visualizations continue to be central in social media analysis, we believe it is necessary to briefly examine the ethical considerations on whether network visualizations such as these should be used in every circumstance. We have chosen here to visualize users participating in a high-prominence topic, consisting of mostly public-facing accounts such as politicians and media outlets. The same methods applied to communities with a higher expectation of privacy, or who face higher risks from exposure, may be unethical surveillance if researchers have not derived consent from members of these communities. There are also ethical implications to naming accounts visualized as nodes in networks. Some users, due to gender, race, or other factors, are at higher risk of harassment if identified as influential in a given community, while other users who explicitly seek attention in online communities may use their identification in networks as a propaganda tool in hateful campaigns. In our reporting of this work, we have declined to name some accounts for both reasons. We also stress here how the data collection procedure, and subsequent description of that procedure, affects which communities appear to be participating in a phenomenon. Several politically-active Twitter communities in the US that have been previously described in research, such as Black Twitter (Clark 2019) and non-English language communities (Fang 2021; Soto-Vasquez et al. 2020), are not explicitly visible in our analysis, likely due to their different posting volumes and the choice of terms and topics on which we chose to center our data collection. Researchers working with such visualizations whose research bears on policy and public perception must explain such limitations in the communication of theirwork. We have described the basic form of an approach for visualizing engagements in social network data, and there are many ways in which this method can be modified to more saliently  capture  engagement  dynamics.  For  example,  the current formulation of this method places emphasis on users who frequently share content, which is not necessarily undesirable given the external impact of this behavior. However, different  formulations  of  the  network  projection  scheme, such as those that weight users’ engagements relative to their average level of engagement, may be a better reflection of real discourse communities that exist at lower sharing volumes.  We  also  observe  that  many  of  these  coengagement networks create densely-connected subgraphs in which most nodes are connected to most other nodes, making internode relationships difficult to visually identify. Accordingly, these networks may be complementary with other techniques to improve visualizations of social networks, such as the edge sparsification  procedures  for  densely-connected  networks proposed by Nocaj et al. (2015). In  the  hopes  that  others  may  replicate  our  methods  of both visualization and analysis on new datasets, we make the code available for generating these graphs either from structured data received from the Twitter API, or in general JSON and CSV-based formats. This code uses the visualization capabilities of the open-source network visualization library Gephi, and its implementation of the ForceAtlas algorithm for network visualization (Bastian, Heymann, and Jacomy2009; Jacomy et al. 2014). We have packaged this code in publicly-available  Docker  containers,  a  relatively  portable and stable code format which can be run on many machines with relatively few installation requirements. Additionally, we have made available node and link data for all visualizations displayed in this paper, as well as a list of Twitter ID numbers for tweets and users corresponding to data used to generate these graphs. We hope by making the code for generating these graphs open-source, other researchers both qualitative and quantitative will both explore the potential and limitations of this method, as well as contribute modifications to this scheme as appropriate.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Data  Collection  and  Management: This  study  only  uses public  data  provided  by  Twitter  and  the  Internet  Archive, both of which have been analyzed extensively by previous work. To comply with the Twitter Terms of Service and protect the privacy of Twitter users, we do not share the data of repurposed accounts from the popular dataset. However, we share the ids of the repurposed accounts from the integrity dataset, since these accounts have already been made public by Twitter and, as such, there is no risk of further harms in their release. Threats to User Anonymity and PrivacyWe additionally mitigate any privacy loss to normal Twitter users by limiting our study to only two types of accounts: 1) accounts in the civic integrity dataset which have been designated by Twitter as harmful to public dialogue and released by Twitter, and 2) popular accounts which can influence the public. For an account to be considered “popular”, we follow Twitter’s lead in choosing a threshold of 5,000 followers, the threshold Twitter uses in the civic integrity dataset to determine if a user’s profile be made public. This group of accounts does include legitimate users who do not intend to mislead others or participate in malicious activity, and in the course of our study, we  uncovered  their  former  account  names/old  profiles via parsing publicly available data. This may include accidental deanonymization of a currently pseudonymized account if the user self-stated their identity in an old version of their profile  and  posted  enough  tweets  from  the  old  version  of their account to appear in the 1% sample. We mitigated this risk to the best of our availability by not releasing the data publicly, performing the annotation ourselves to not expose the data to crowd workers, and not reading their tweets. Further Potential Impacts of WorkWe must also consider the impact of publishing such a study and making this type of platform manipulation known to the general public and academic community. First, we hope that this work raises awareness among Twitter users that accounts that they follow may be repurposed for malicious purposes so that they can  notice  such  accounts  when  they  see  them,  and possibly even report them as malicious. We also hope that pointing out and studying this phenomenon urges academics and Twitter alike to put more resources into mitigation methods that do not have negative impacts on normal users, especially those from already marginalized groups. Awareness goes both ways, though, and this paper could also lead to malicious users learning about repurposing. This could lead to some who did not know that repurposing was possible to maliciously repurpose more accounts. However, we know from the widespread use of malicious repurposing that this phenomenon is already known by many who wish to use it maliciously. By bringing this problem to light, we hope to mitigate this risk by promoting user and platform awareness, thus discouraging its use. Although the goal of this paper is to uncover malicious re-purposing, parts of our methodology could be repurposed to deanonymize users who want to remain anonymous, as long as at one point in the past their account had an identifiable attribute. Users should be made aware that if they wish to remain anonymous, a new account should be created from scratch rather than repurposing a non-anonymous account. Finally, this work further illustrates that deletion privacy is important for users, but that it also can prevent malicious activity from being discovered. While users need to be able to  delete  and  hide  their  prior  activities  and  accounts,  this study underlines how such mechanisms can be misused to mislead and deceive users.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Addressing the previously unknown, we describe NigerianTwitter and highlight that interpretable and fair algorithms can provide comparably high performance to more advanced but less  transparent  and  potentially  more  biased  methods. Broadly speaking, beyond describing Nigerian Twitter, we expect  that  the  utility  of  this  approach  will  be  evident  in future work that relies on demographic inference to evaluate policy impact. Yet, we acknowledge that our approach, as well as broader research aimed at inferring demographic attributes of users, may raise several ethical concerns. For instance, the tools developed can be used for profiling purposes in pursuit of malicious objectives. Due to the accessibility of available tools and the high risk of re-identification (Rocher, Hendrickx, and De Montjoye 2019), the data used for development and evaluation may be sensitive and require confidentiality. Moreover,  we  are  aware  that  name-based demographic inference may  disproportionately  miscategorize minority groups and  individuals  which  can  have  serious empirical and ethical consequences, as extensively discussed in Lock-hart, King, and Munsch (2023). In this work, we only provide a modeling pipeline aimed at accurately inferring demographic traits of social media users and thus remain agnostic on the usage of such tool. In doing so, we leave it to practitioners and researchers who wish to incorporate such information in their analysis to estimate whether their workis  ethically  desirable.  It  is  our  responsibility,  however,  to draw attention to a number of critical points and limitations, which should be taken into account when evaluating whether future work building on our methods is ethically justified. In the  following,  we  build  on  the  suggestions  formulated  by Lockhart, King, and Munsch (2023). First, our method produces attributes based on external ascriptions, and therefore should be used in case studies where one is interested in external ascription, e.g. how social media users perceive each other, instead of focusing on a user’s true sense of self-identity. Additionally, our method builds on labels produced and revised by local domain experts who have a strong knowledge of the extent to which names or profiles signal  certain  traits,  as  described  in  §3.3.  Labels assigned without such precaution might not be as accurate and produce erroneous inferences. We try to limit subjective judgments and individual biases in the annotation processby duplicating the labeling task among our four experts and by making sure disagreements are arbitrated. This however does not impede unfair biases being shared by all of our an-notators, despite their level of expertise. Further, for each demographic attribute, we limit ourselves to traits which can be retrieved from a user’s name with high accuracy in a given population, as demonstrated by our name matching results. In doing so, we fail to capture a variety of subgroups, including non-binary individuals, ethnic minorities, and traditional faiths, as resources are lacking for these groups which could result in developing poorly performing models. This draws a limitation of our approach: while providing accurate predictions at the aggregated level, it disregards minority sub-groups, which limits inclusivity. Any downstream usage of methods or data similar to ours should take this limitation into account. Finally, as our pipeline is accurate at an aggregated level, downstream applications relying on similar data should preferably make use of demographic predictions at the group level, as individual predictions might contain erroneous associations which could add confounds to the modeling pipeline.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Our work, in conjunction with existing work (Ashokkumarand Pennebaker 2021; Biester et al. 2021), shows that the pandemic  had  different  effects  on  different  communities. Further, we show that signals from social media can be predictive of how a community copes with adversity. We found that cities more affected by the pandemic tended to have less connected members and had previously placed more importance on life aspects that were most impacted by social distancing during the pandemic, such as seeing friends and participating in group activities. Our features were predictive of whether a city’s wellbeing was affected by the pandemic. However,  predicting  the  subsequent  recovery  trajectory  of affected  cities  proved  to  be  more  difficult,  implying  that there are other factors involved and further work is needed to understand community resilience over time. Our findings indicate that differential policies should be put in place for communities, based on the pandemic’s local impact. Cities more impacted by social distancing measures may need to place higher priority on re-establishing social activities, such as local events and cultural festivals. Furthermore, policymakers could use automatically derived signals from social media as a real-time source of feedback for their policies, especially during times that require quick decision-making like during the pandemic. However, it’s important that such factors are considered holistically. A limitation of our findings is that they do not necessarily reflect the general public. Our work focuses on a single social media site (Reddit) where the users tend to be young (7) and male (8). Further, Reddit activity may potentially overrepresent the number of people affected by the pandemic (e.g., more people joining and posting due to physical lockdowns) or  exclude  those  who  largely  ignored  the  pandemic.  Our analyses look  at all posts  and  do  not  focus  only  on  posts that relate to COVID-19, which may lessen this bias. Additionally, there are many other facets of how communities acted during COVID, such as their general compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures or vaccination rates. However, further studies using other social media, surveys, and more facets of how communities acted during COVID (e.g., mask adherence, general compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures) can help support and extend our insights. Because our study is based solely on observational data, we  cannot  establish  causal  links  between  the  community characteristics we have identified and the wellbeing recovery outcomes. To address this, future work could involve col-lecting ground truth data about city recovery and resilience, such as through large surveys of individuals in each city regarding their wellbeing during the pandemic. Finally, our study should not be construed to be a comprehensive study of wellbeing. Subjective wellbeing does not consist solely of the presence of positive affect. It is more complex and multi-faceted, involving other aspects such as life satisfaction which are impacted in different ways (Ket-tlewell et al. 2020). Future work could study how community factors relate to these additional aspects of wellbeing. Furthermore, the relation of our wellbeing metric to metrics such as self-reported life satisfaction has not been studied; a misalignment between stance expressed in social media and public opinion surveys has been noted in prior work (Josephet  al.  2021),  and  we  leave  it  to  future  work  to  study  how wellbeing as expressed in social media posts relates to self-reported wellbeing.</td>\n",

       "42   While our research aims to generate positive societal impact via increasing equity in SNAP enrollment, there remains a primary ethical consideration: in optimizing for SNAP enrollment among minority demographics, we inherently reduce the SNAP enrollment among majority demographics. Below, we discuss this trade-off and its potential societal impact, as well as concerns arising from data collection. For each  source  of  potential  negative  societal  impact,  we  describe the principles used to mitigate our concerns. The crux of our work involves setting a fixed budget for an advertising bidding algorithm, and optimizing for potential SNAP enrollees who are Spanish speakers. For each additional Spanish speaking individual presented with a Get-CalFresh  ad,  we  will  necessarily  decrease  the  number  of English speaking individuals presented with the same ad — potentially by more than one. The long term consequences of  our  experiment  include  that  certain  individuals belonging to majority groups will not be shown the GetCalFresh ad, and will thus have a lower likelihood of filling out Get-CalFresh’s SNAP application when searching for the same Google keywords that would otherwise trigger the GetCal-Fresh ad to be shown. Across California, we hope to see an increase in SNAP applications from individuals who would not otherwise have easily found the online resources to complete the forms, in keeping with GetCalFresh’s goal of assisting the neediest individuals. If applied broadly, our framework can be used to substantiate decision-makers’ choices across a range of algorithm-based applications. Depending on the individuals and groups whose preferences are surveyed, this could either yield policy suggestions that propose more equity-based allocations, or ones that propose more efficiency-based allocations as is the norm. The key distinction will stem from whose preferences are elicited, and whether their fairness preferences are biased outside the scope of the efficiency-equity trade-off. One way to ameliorate this concern is to ensure representation of underrepresented groups among individuals whose preferences are being elicited (Kasy and Abebe 2021; Whit-taker 2020). As  to  the  ethical  challenges  of  data  collection,  this research uses data on three fronts: first, from Google ad target-ing towards a large swath of Google users in California; second, from Code for America’s compilation of GetCalFreshapplications; and third, from our Prolific survey. In Google ad targeting, we do not have access to any individual-level data; rather, we can only see audience-level statistics (e.g., how many total impressions or clicks were received on an ad). In the GetCalFresh applications, Code for America continuously tracks all applications that come through its system,  but  takes  particular  care  to  ensure  data  privacy.  For example, even though one could argue the benefits of collecting race-based data from users to optimize for racial equity, the GetCalFresh application does not collect race data at all because the application does not require race information. Further, our team only obtained access to anonymized household-level data pertaining to the research at hand. In the Prolific survey, we pre-registered our experiment viaAsPredicted(#84866),  indicating  what  individual-level  data we aimed to collect; we made the decision to not publicly re-lease said data for Prolific user privacy reasons—our dataset includes sensitive  information  such  as  political  affiliationand income levels, which were imperative to collect to understand the socioeconomic drivers of fairness preferences. Across these three data sources, we have minimized the potential data privacy harm to the extent possible while still allowing for this research to be conducted. The survey question text,  along  with  code  reproducing  data  analysis,  are posted on GitHub for reproducibility. Across both the inherent demographic trade-off and data privacy considerations, we have made the choices we feel best  lead  to  equitable  outcomes  for  the  neediest  potential GetCalFresh users, with minimal harm to the broader set of potential users. While our research focuses on SNAP within California, there is room for future work both across America, and via analogous food stamp programs globally. However, our design choices would need to be revisited since the concept of neediest recipients may vary considerably in different contexts.  \\\n",
       "5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As network visualizations continue to be central in social media analysis, we believe it is necessary to briefly examine the ethical considerations on whether network visualizations such as these should be used in every circumstance. We have chosen here to visualize users participating in a high-prominence topic, consisting of mostly public-facing accounts such as politicians and media outlets. The same methods applied to communities with a higher expectation of privacy, or who face higher risks from exposure, may be unethical surveillance if researchers have not derived consent from members of these communities. There are also ethical implications to naming accounts visualized as nodes in networks. Some users, due to gender, race, or other factors, are at higher risk of harassment if identified as influential in a given community, while other users who explicitly seek attention in online communities may use their identification in networks as a propaganda tool in hateful campaigns. In our reporting of this work, we have declined to name some accounts for both reasons. We also stress here how the data collection procedure, and subsequent description of that procedure, affects which communities appear to be participating in a phenomenon. Several politically-active Twitter communities in the US that have been previously described in research, such as Black Twitter (Clark 2019) and non-English language communities (Fang 2021; Soto-Vasquez et al. 2020), are not explicitly visible in our analysis, likely due to their different posting volumes and the choice of terms and topics on which we chose to center our data collection. Researchers working with such visualizations whose research bears on policy and public perception must explain such limitations in the communication of theirwork. We have described the basic form of an approach for visualizing engagements in social network data, and there are many ways in which this method can be modified to more saliently  capture  engagement  dynamics.  For  example,  the current formulation of this method places emphasis on users who frequently share content, which is not necessarily undesirable given the external impact of this behavior. However, different  formulations  of  the  network  projection  scheme, such as those that weight users’ engagements relative to their average level of engagement, may be a better reflection of real discourse communities that exist at lower sharing volumes.  We  also  observe  that  many  of  these  coengagement networks create densely-connected subgraphs in which most nodes are connected to most other nodes, making internode relationships difficult to visually identify. Accordingly, these networks may be complementary with other techniques to improve visualizations of social networks, such as the edge sparsification  procedures  for  densely-connected  networks proposed by Nocaj et al. (2015). In  the  hopes  that  others  may  replicate  our  methods  of both visualization and analysis on new datasets, we make the code available for generating these graphs either from structured data received from the Twitter API, or in general JSON and CSV-based formats. This code uses the visualization capabilities of the open-source network visualization library Gephi, and its implementation of the ForceAtlas algorithm for network visualization (Bastian, Heymann, and Jacomy2009; Jacomy et al. 2014). We have packaged this code in publicly-available  Docker  containers,  a  relatively  portable and stable code format which can be run on many machines with relatively few installation requirements. Additionally, we have made available node and link data for all visualizations displayed in this paper, as well as a list of Twitter ID numbers for tweets and users corresponding to data used to generate these graphs. We hope by making the code for generating these graphs open-source, other researchers both qualitative and quantitative will both explore the potential and limitations of this method, as well as contribute modifications to this scheme as appropriate.   \n",

To comply with the Twitter Terms of Service and protect the privacy of Twitter users, we do not share the data of repurposed accounts from the popular dataset. However, we share the ids of the repurposed accounts from the integrity dataset, since these accounts have already been made public by Twitter and, as such, there is no risk of further harms in their release. Threats to User Anonymity and PrivacyWe additionally mitigate any privacy loss to normal Twitter users by limiting our study to only two types of accounts: 1) accounts in the civic integrity dataset which have been designated by Twitter as harmful to public dialogue and released by Twitter, and 2) popular accounts which can influence the public. For an account to be considered “popular”, we follow Twitter’s lead in choosing a threshold of 5,000 followers, the threshold Twitter uses in the civic integrity dataset to determine if a user’s profile be made public. This group of accounts does include legitimate users who do not intend to mislead others or participate in malicious activity, and in the course of our study, we  uncovered  their  former  account  names/old  profiles via parsing publicly available data. This may include accidental deanonymization of a currently pseudonymized account if the user self-stated their identity in an old version of their profile  and  posted  enough  tweets  from  the  old  version  of their account to appear in the 1% sample. We mitigated this risk to the best of our availability by not releasing the data publicly, performing the annotation ourselves to not expose the data to crowd workers, and not reading their tweets. Further Potential Impacts of WorkWe must also consider the impact of publishing such a study and making this type of platform manipulation known to the general public and academic community. First, we hope that this work raises awareness among Twitter users that accounts that they follow may be repurposed for malicious purposes so that they can  notice  such  accounts  when  they  see  them,  and possibly even report them as malicious. We also hope that pointing out and studying this phenomenon urges academics and Twitter alike to put more resources into mitigation methods that do not have negative impacts on normal users, especially those from already marginalized groups. Awareness goes both ways, though, and this paper could also lead to malicious users learning about repurposing. This could lead to some who did not know that repurposing was possible to maliciously repurpose more accounts. However, we know from the widespread use of malicious repurposing that this phenomenon is already known by many who wish to use it maliciously. By bringing this problem to light, we hope to mitigate this risk by promoting user and platform awareness, thus discouraging its use. Although the goal of this paper is to uncover malicious re-purposing, parts of our methodology could be repurposed to deanonymize users who want to remain anonymous, as long as at one point in the past their account had an identifiable attribute. Users should be made aware that if they wish to remain anonymous, a new account should be created from scratch rather than repurposing a non-anonymous account. Finally, this work further illustrates that deletion privacy is important for users, but that it also can prevent malicious activity from being discovered. While users need to be able to  delete  and  hide  their  prior  activities  and  accounts,  this study underlines how such mechanisms can be misused to mislead and deceive users.   \n",

Broadly speaking, beyond describing Nigerian Twitter, we expect  that  the  utility  of  this  approach  will  be  evident  in future work that relies on demographic inference to evaluate policy impact. Yet, we acknowledge that our approach, as well as broader research aimed at inferring demographic attributes of users, may raise several ethical concerns. For instance, the tools developed can be used for profiling purposes in pursuit of malicious objectives. Due to the accessibility of available tools and the high risk of re-identification (Rocher, Hendrickx, and De Montjoye 2019), the data used for development and evaluation may be sensitive and require confidentiality. Moreover,  we  are  aware  that  name-based demographic inference may  disproportionately  miscategorize minority groups and  individuals  which  can  have  serious empirical and ethical consequences, as extensively discussed in Lock-hart, King, and Munsch (2023). In this work, we only provide a modeling pipeline aimed at accurately inferring demographic traits of social media users and thus remain agnostic on the usage of such tool. In doing so, we leave it to practitioners and researchers who wish to incorporate such information in their analysis to estimate whether their workis  ethically  desirable.  It  is  our  responsibility,  however,  to draw attention to a number of critical points and limitations, which should be taken into account when evaluating whether future work building on our methods is ethically justified. In the  following,  we  build  on  the  suggestions  formulated  by Lockhart, King, and Munsch (2023). First, our method produces attributes based on external ascriptions, and therefore should be used in case studies where one is interested in external ascription, e.g. how social media users perceive each other, instead of focusing on a user’s true sense of self-identity. Additionally, our method builds on labels produced and revised by local domain experts who have a strong knowledge of the extent to which names or profiles signal  certain  traits,  as  described  in  §3.3.  Labels assigned without such precaution might not be as accurate and produce erroneous inferences. We try to limit subjective judgments and individual biases in the annotation processby duplicating the labeling task among our four experts and by making sure disagreements are arbitrated. This however does not impede unfair biases being shared by all of our an-notators, despite their level of expertise. Further, for each demographic attribute, we limit ourselves to traits which can be retrieved from a user’s name with high accuracy in a given population, as demonstrated by our name matching results. In doing so, we fail to capture a variety of subgroups, including non-binary individuals, ethnic minorities, and traditional faiths, as resources are lacking for these groups which could result in developing poorly performing models. This draws a limitation of our approach: while providing accurate predictions at the aggregated level, it disregards minority sub-groups, which limits inclusivity. Any downstream usage of methods or data similar to ours should take this limitation into account. Finally, as our pipeline is accurate at an aggregated level, downstream applications relying on similar data should preferably make use of demographic predictions at the group level, as individual predictions might contain erroneous associations which could add confounds to the modeling pipeline.   \n",

Further, we show that signals from social media can be predictive of how a community copes with adversity. We found that cities more affected by the pandemic tended to have less connected members and had previously placed more importance on life aspects that were most impacted by social distancing during the pandemic, such as seeing friends and participating in group activities. Our features were predictive of whether a city’s wellbeing was affected by the pandemic. However,  predicting  the  subsequent  recovery  trajectory  of affected  cities  proved  to  be  more  difficult,  implying  that there are other factors involved and further work is needed to understand community resilience over time. Our findings indicate that differential policies should be put in place for communities, based on the pandemic’s local impact. Cities more impacted by social distancing measures may need to place higher priority on re-establishing social activities, such as local events and cultural festivals. Furthermore, policymakers could use automatically derived signals from social media as a real-time source of feedback for their policies, especially during times that require quick decision-making like during the pandemic. However, it’s important that such factors are considered holistically. A limitation of our findings is that they do not necessarily reflect the general public. Our work focuses on a single social media site (Reddit) where the users tend to be young (7) and male (8). Further, Reddit activity may potentially overrepresent the number of people affected by the pandemic (e.g., more people joining and posting due to physical lockdowns) or  exclude  those  who  largely  ignored  the  pandemic.  Our analyses look  at all posts  and  do  not  focus  only  on  posts that relate to COVID-19, which may lessen this bias. Additionally, there are many other facets of how communities acted during COVID, such as their general compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures or vaccination rates. However, further studies using other social media, surveys, and more facets of how communities acted during COVID (e.g., mask adherence, general compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures) can help support and extend our insights. Because our study is based solely on observational data, we  cannot  establish  causal  links  between  the  community characteristics we have identified and the wellbeing recovery outcomes. To address this, future work could involve col-lecting ground truth data about city recovery and resilience, such as through large surveys of individuals in each city regarding their wellbeing during the pandemic. Finally, our study should not be construed to be a comprehensive study of wellbeing. Subjective wellbeing does not consist solely of the presence of positive affect. It is more complex and multi-faceted, involving other aspects such as life satisfaction which are impacted in different ways (Ket-tlewell et al. 2020). Future work could study how community factors relate to these additional aspects of wellbeing.

For example, our analysis requires collecting data about which Tweets users view while using Twitter, and also requires human annotators to review and rate potentially abusive content. Overall, we agree with researchers who view this type of work as necessary for understanding and protecting democratic discourse , especially in terms of standard risk-benefit frameworks. Still, it is important to note different measures taken to address potential risks. While the holdback experiment is necessary, it is not ideal for many users to be excluded from algorithmic timeline features. Twitter has thus worked to provide more users access to algorithmic timelines while maintaining statistical robustness in the holdback experiment. As of , the experiment included over  million active accounts in the reverse-chronological timeline group (Husz ́ar ), but when this analysis was conducted in , that number had been reduced to 630k. This study was not subject to an academic IRB process, however, it went through standard legal and privacy review processes at Twitter. Finally, the data used in this paper was fully anonymized for publication, following standard ethical procedures. We do not include any results that might disclose the identity of any account in the datasets.</td>\n",

All the results provide aggregated estimates and do not include any information on individuals. The users in our study were fully aware of  the  public  nature  and  free  accessibility  of  the  content they posted since the subreddits are of public domain, are not password-protected, and have thousands of active subscribers.  Reddit’s  pseudonymous  accounts  make  the  retrieval  of  the  true  identity  of  users  unlikely.  Nevertheless, as  a  further  privacy  measure,  the  authors’  names  were anonymized before  using the data  for analysis.  Therefore, our research did not require informed consent.   \n",
       "2    This study intersects with a number of topics related to the ethics of algorithmic platforms. For example, our analysis requires collecting data about which Tweets users view while using Twitter, and also requires human annotators to review and rate potentially abusive content. Overall, we agree with researchers who view this type of work as necessary for understanding and protecting democratic discourse , especially in terms of standard risk-benefit frameworks. Still, it is important to note different measures taken to address potential risks. While the holdback experiment is necessary, it is not ideal for many users to be excluded from algorithmic timeline features. Twitter has thus worked to provide more users access to algorithmic timelines while maintaining statistical robustness in the holdback experiment. As of , the experiment included over  million active accounts in the reverse-chronological timeline group (Husz ́ar ), but when this analysis was conducted in , that number had been reduced to 630k. This study was not subject to an academic IRB process, however, it went through standard legal and privacy review processes at Twitter. Finally, the data used in this paper was fully anonymized for publication, following standard ethical procedures. We do not include any results that might disclose the identity of any account in the datasets.   \n",

All analyses are based on publicly available data and we do not make any attempt to track users across different platforms. We neither de-anonymize nor de-identify their accounts.

Our approach actively aims to minimize risks of misuse and intrusion by avoiding user-identifiable data, such as demographic identities and spatial coordinates. Thus, our model may be preferable in highly sensitive settings. The datasets were anonymized before analysis. All experiments were conducted in Snapchat’s internal secure storage systems, and no data was stored outside Snapchat’s ecosystem. Thus, we do not foresee strong ethical concerns induced by our work.   \n",

Our work provides several potential benefits for society, including an audit of the steps ostensibly being taken to combat harm on Twitter, and a new way to detect hate speech at scale using commercial APIs as well as a curated list of hate words. Perspective API, which we use to classify hate, is run by Alphabet, a competitor to Twitter, but we believe this does not affect our results.   \n",

Given  the  minimum  group  size of , any individual re-identification risk is minimal. However,  there  is  a  risk  of  group-level  harm  by  mapping vulnerable populations, such as those of a particular faith. To mitigate this risk, Facebook removed targeting attributes related to religion and other sensitive attributes, including the one used in this study5. Note, however, that our study does not target  Muslim  migrants  themselves but natives’ non-Muslimin  the  respective  countries,  limiting  the potential group harm. Still, the removal of the targeting attribute of“friends of people who have engaged with Ramadan” limits the reproducibility. Given the sensitivity of the topic, we commit to sharing our data with other researchers upon request   \n",

Firstly,  our  research highlights the variations in psycho-linguistic features between Facebook and SMS, thus warranting further investigation of  downstream  applications.  Secondly,  future researchers can build predictive models on large-scale social media language and apply them to SMS, which may offer a new approach to address the cost-accuracy trade-off in the context of just-in-time interventions on mobile devices. This study involves human subjects and was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The data used in this study raise ethical concerns such as handling sensitive personal information (PII) and thus, we have taken measures to securely store, clean, and analyze the data, further data sharing is not possible . We use social media, SMS data, and machine learning methods to estimate sensitive attributes like depression. Such estimates can have both positive and negative implications, ranging from providing support to causing discrimination. We must use them with caution   \n",

We did not send any Tweets and did not interact with other Twitter accounts. Our only variables extracted from the Twitterdata were Tweet IDs, timestamps of when the Tweets were created, and the impression count, which is part of the public metric variable. No Tweet texts, account profile information, or other information that could identify individuals or groups (PII) were analyzed. Reproducibility: All data from the analyses of this article are available online (www.pfeffer.at/data/halflife). The data includes all  Tweet  IDs,  Tweet  creation  time,  and  for each collection iteration for every Tweet, its collection time, and the number of views. Since the views are a function of when the Tweets are collected, we have expanded the JSON response data from the Twitter API that is stored in files with the exact time of every API query.   \n",

       "46   [the results presented in this paper show that subreddit links have a substantive impact on community creation and activity levels within established communities on reddit., based on these findings, we recognize the possible applications, both good and bad., we therefore outline here the potential impacts and strategies to mitigate them., potential impacts: as with most social media research, the work presented here is subject to unique ethical considerations., the line between positive and negative outcomes is often very thin in this domain, and the potential uses of subreddit links are no different., intention and nuance are critical in evaluating the ethics of these community promotions, as the mechanism of use is the same for helpful and harmful instances., given that we have shown how subreddit links influence the community landscape on reddit, one possible negative outcome is the manipulation of these subreddit links by bad actors to push a particular agenda or viewpoint., community-focused misinformation contributes to siloing and echo chambers, fueling conflict., similarly, users could co-opt common links by creating a community whose purpose does not match the subreddit name, potentially exposing other users to harmful or malicious content., to mitigate these negative impacts, reddit and other social media platforms may need to monitor the frequency of subreddit links and the formation of new communities to detect and intervene in cases of misuse., there are also positive outcomes that could result from this work., first, a better understanding of the power of subreddit links could allow for new avenues of content promotion., for example, users can direct other commenters to specific helpful subreddits based on the context of the discussion., this is already a common use case of subreddit links, but with concrete evidence of link impact, organizations could adopt the convention for good, like recommendation of mental health communities., subreddit links could also be leveraged in the fight against misinformation and disinformation, by directing users to communities with more rigorous moderation and fact-checking., limitationsthese findings are limited to subreddit communities on reddit., these findings are likely to generalize to other social media platforms, but further experiments are required to confirm., our experiments assume that all subreddit links are deliberate choices made by users, and therefore may incorrectly capture some links that were mistakes or typos., however, even if a subreddit link was made by mistake, any well-formed link will point to a subreddit that may or may not exist., in compiling the link dataset, we considered all well-formed links, without filtering for link score or visibility, community size, or other factors that could impact a link’s effectiveness., future work investigating these nuances may reveal trends or effect not discovered in this aggregate analysis., data collection and privacy considerationsbecause this data contains artifacts of human subjects, we sought human subjects review from the ethical review board at the university of notre dame; an exemption was granted for this study on the basis that all data was public and no treatments were conducted by the research team., additionally, most reddit users act anonymously, but any personal information was  willingly  shared  by  the  user., all results presented are in aggregate., we did not seek nor attempt to de-anonymize any data and therefore do not reveal any private or personally identifying information., the  dataset  used  for  experiments  is  available  fromfiles.pushshift.io/reddit., we encourage interested parties to contact us for more details on dataset compilation and analysis., all plots include confidence intervals as appropriate., all experiments were conducted on a local high-capacity cpu machine.]   \n",
